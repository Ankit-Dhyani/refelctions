When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
>>When I want to share my work woth other people, so that they can also use/update the files. It actually promotes the team work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
>>Sometimes we might not to update the local repository with the work done by some other team mate and pushed into the remote.  Or we might be working on the branch and not want to pull data from the remote in between.
