What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
>>When we initialize a repository .git file gets added to the directory we are in and it becomes a git repository.
We need to do it to make our directory a git repository so that we can leverage the benifits of git mainly version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
>>Staging area acts as the middle man between working directory and the repository. Whern we run "git add <file name>" command that file is first moves to staging area. We cn add as many files as we want in the staging area before commiting it in the directory.
So using this we can commit the related files at once in a singe commit and leave the unrelated files.
